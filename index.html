            <p>Here are some of the projects I've been working on.</p>
            <p>Berkeley Sublet was my first coding project and where I learned all the basics of web design. I thought a big project was the best way to go about learning code + web design, so check that out.</p>
            <p>Picture is the temporary name for a platform I've been making to manage my biometric data exactly as I want. The goal is beautiful visualizations and a better understanding of the biometric data recorded from my Garmin and Oura.</p>
